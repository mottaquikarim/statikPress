# statikPress

__(a super simple markdown based static site generator built with nodejs)__

## How to run

1. `git clone https://github.com/mottaquikarim/statikPress/tree/master`
2. `npm install`
3. `node press`

## Adding new content

1. `node app/newfile -h`

If you don't use sublime text as default text editor and would prefer to vim it (vim ftw!), open up configs/config and replace editor, editorArgs with:

`
    editor: 'vim',
    editorArgs: []
`
